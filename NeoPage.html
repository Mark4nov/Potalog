    I am 1 year old and my owner is TacoDeLechuga!  I was born in 
    <a href='http://www.neopets.com/prehistoric/index.phtml'><b>Tyrannia</b></a>, a very 
    interesting place where anything can happen!  Now and again #OWNER takes me back to 
    Tyrannia and I go to see a rock concert.  My favourite band are the Sticks and Stones, 
    but it is very hard to get tickets as everyone wants to see them live.

    So where does a Pteri like me live?  Well apart from my cosy Neohome, I like to sleep 
    outside under the stars.  You just can't beat a nice soft nest made from fresh Lavaberry 
    leaves.  This is a photo of me and some of my friends, messing around as usual :)  
    <p>
    Some people say that is all us Pterii do, but I don't think so.  We just like to have 
    fun and laugh a lot.  Its better than being a boring, lazy, old Skeith!

    So what does a cute little creature like me enjoy eating?<br>
    My favourite food is a piece of 
    <a href='http://www.neopets.com/prehistoric/omelette.phtml'>
    <b> Giant Omelette</b></a> fresh from the rock in Tyrannia.  It truly is 
    the nicest thing I have ever tasted.  Sausage and pepperoni or carrot and pea are the 
    best!
